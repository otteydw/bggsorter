"""BGG Sorter 2

This Flask application provides functionality to sort and manage board game collections
for users based on their BoardGameGeek (BGG) profiles. It allows users to interactively
rank their games and view their sorted game collections.

Main features:
- Fetch and store user's played games from BoardGameGeek
- Interactive game sorting using a binary insertion sort algorithm
- Display all games and top games for a user
- Save and load user data from JSON files

The application uses Flask for web routing and rendering templates, and interacts
with the BoardGameGeek API to retrieve user game data.

Usage:
    Run this script to start the Flask development server.
    Access the application through a web browser at the provided local URL.

Note:
    This application is intended for development and testing purposes.
    For production deployment, consider using a production-grade WSGI server.

    Load user data from a JSON file.

    This function attempts to load user data from a JSON file named after the
    provided username. If the file exists, it reads and returns the data.
    If the file doesn't exist, it returns a default data structure.

    Args:
        username (str): The username of the user whose data should be loaded.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the user's data with two keys:
            - 'unsorted': A list of unsorted items (default: empty list)
            - 'sorted': A list of sorted items (default: empty list)

    Notes:
        - The function expects JSON files to be stored in the directory specified
          by the DATA_DIR constant.
        - If the file doesn't exist, no error is raised. Instead, a default
          structure is returned.

    Example:
        >>> user_data = load_data('johndoe')
        >>> print(user_data)
